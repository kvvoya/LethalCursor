# Lethal Cursor

This is a mod that allows you to change your cursor in the UI elements to whatever image you want! ðŸŒŸ

I made this mod for my bestie Yzis, because she had a weird bug that made it so the cursor is always visible.

## How to use


1. The default cursor this mod will use as a replacement is just one white pixel. There are two ways to change it. Go to the configuration of the mod and set the path of your image there. Alternatively, go to the mod's folder and replace the file called cursor.png but keep the default path in the config file.
2. By default, the hotspot is set on the top left corner. You can change the hotspot coordinates in the configuration of a mod. I advise you to have your cursor of 32x32 size.
3. If you wish to disable the mod and see the default picture again, you can disable the mod in the configuration as well
